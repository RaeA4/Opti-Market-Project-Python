# OptiMarket Membership Campaign Optimization

## Project Overview
This project applies predictive modeling to improve 
OptiMarket’s marketing campaign strategy.

Using data from five previous campaigns, we built a model 
to identify customers most likely to purchase a $199 
premium membership.

The goal: increase conversions, reduce campaign costs, 
and support data-driven targeting decisions.

## Business Problem
OptiMarket currently targets customers at random.

This results in:
- Low conversion rates
- High campaign costs
- Missed opportunities

We aim to:
- Predict likely buyers of the premium membership
- Minimize false negatives
- Allocate offers more effectively and fairly

## Approach

### 1. Problem Definition
- Clarified objectives with a focus on ROI
- Framed a binary classification problem
- Defined evaluation metrics (recall, F1-score, etc.)

### 2. Data Analysis & Preparation
- Cleaned and preprocessed raw campaign data
- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Engineered features and handled class imbalance

### 3. Model Development
- Tested Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost
- Tuned hyperparameters for optimal performance
- Prioritized reducing false negatives

### 4. Business Insights
- Interpreted model outputs to guide targeting strategy
- Suggested steps to reduce spend and improve impact
- Considered fairness and ethical model deployment
